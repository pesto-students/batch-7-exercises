      <p>
        This recipe makes quick, tasty hummus, with no messing. It has been
        adapted from a number of different recipes that I have read over the
        years.

        Hummus is a delicious thick paste used heavily in Greek and Middle
        Eastern dishes. It is very tasty with salad, grilled meats and pitta
        breads.

      <ol>
        <li>Remove the skin from the garlic, and chop coarsely</li>

        <li>Process all the ingredients into a paste.</li>
        <li>
          If you want a coarse "chunky" hummus, process it for a short time
        </li>
        <li>If you want a smooth hummus, process it for a longer time</li>
      </ol>
      For a different flavour,you could try blending in a small measure of lemon
      and coriander, chili pepper, lime and chipotle, harissa and mint, or
      spinach and feta cheese. Experiment and see what works for you.

        <b>Storage</b>
      </header>
      <p>
        Refrigerate the finished hummus in a sealed container. You should be
        able to use it for about a week after you've made it. If it starts to
        become fizzy, you should definitelydiscard it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hummus is suitable for freezing; you should thaw it and use it within a
        couple of months.
