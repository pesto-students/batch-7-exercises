Write a class for a checking account that validates itâ€™s created with valid parameters.
A SavingsAccount has an accountNumber, email, firstName, lastName all set through the
constructor and an array of products that is initially empty.
Don't forget to use getters and setters
Each parameter must meet specific requirements (see test cases for SavingsAccount)
