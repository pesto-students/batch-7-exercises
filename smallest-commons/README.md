# Instructions 

Find the smallest common multiple of the provided parameters that
can be evenly divided by both, as well as by all sequential numbers
in the range between these parameters.
The range will be an array of two numbers that will not
necessarily be in numerical order.
e.g. for 1 and 3 - find the smallest common multiple of
both 1 and 3 that is evenly divisible by all numbers between 1 and 3.
